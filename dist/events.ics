SUMMARY:MHN: Legiana Weekend
DESCRIPTION:As temperatures drop in swamp habitats, increasing numbers of L
 egiana coming to prey on Raphinos have been spotted. It looks like we ca
 n expect more to come! Veiled in frigid air, this monster is capable of 
 a devastating onslaught of attacks. Fire- and poison-element attacks are
  its weaknesses, so gather your equipment and get ready to investigate! 
 During the event, Legiana will appear more frequently than usual for all
  hunters HR11 and above. During the event, monsters in all Habitats will
  reappear in shorter intervals than usual.
