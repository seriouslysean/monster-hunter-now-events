SUMMARY:MHN: Legiana Weekend
DESCRIPTION:Legiana will appear more frequently in Swamp Habitats for all h
 unters HR11 and above. During the event, monsters in all Habitats will r
 eappear in shorter intervals than usual. As temperatures drop in swamp h
 abitats, increasing numbers of Legiana coming to prey on Raphinos have b
 een spotted. It looks like we can expect more to come! Veiled in frigid 
 air, this monster is capable of a devastating onslaught of attacks. Fire
 - and poison-element attacks are its weaknesses, so gather your equipmen
 t and get ready to investigate!
